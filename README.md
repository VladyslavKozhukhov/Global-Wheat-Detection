# Global-Wheat-Detection
The Global Wheat Detection (GWD) computation task is to predict the bounding boxes of wheat heads in different images. Those Images have a varying number of wheat heads, colors, orientations, and are used to estimate the density and size of wheat heads in different varieties.
